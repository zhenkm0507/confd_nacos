# Release Checklist

In order to cut a new release, a few things must be done:

1. auto-generate the CHANGELOG using the provided script
2. bump version.go and docs/installation.md to the new release
3. push a tag for the new release
4. draft a [new release](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/releases/new)
5. bump version.go to the next release, appending `-dev`

For the former, you can use the following script:

    $ echo -e "$(./contrib/generate-changelog.sh v$LATEST_RELEASE)\n" | cat - CHANGELOG | sponge CHANGELOG

You can find `sponge` in the `moreutils` package on Ubuntu.

This script will generate all merged changes since $LATEST_RELEASE and append it to the top of the CHANGELOG. However, this will show up as "HEAD" at the top:

    $ ./contrib/generate-changelog.sh v$LATEST_RELEASE
    ### HEAD

    abc123 Some merged PR summary
    ...

You'll need to manually modify "HEAD" to show up as the latest release.

When drafting a new release, you must make sure that a `darwin`, `linux` and `windows` build of confd have
been uploaded. You must have Docker installed to build release binaries:

    $ make release

You can then drag and drop these binaries into the release draft.
